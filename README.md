    <p>There's nothing new about putting chips on sandwiches. The folks from <a href="http://1000awesomethings.com/2009/04/13/789-putting-potato-chips-on-a-sandwich/"> 1000 Awesome Things </a> and <a href="https://www.thetravelinglocavores.com/turkey-and-the-wolf/"> The Traveling Locavores </a> both love it and more importantly our friends at <a href=https://www.thisisnotdietfood.com/bbq-fritos-chicken-sandwiches/"> This Is Not Diet Food </a> know the joy chips can bring to a sandwich! For many moons people have been increasing textural compositions, caloric content and flavor of their sandwhiches while saving time. My mission here is to guide you to some of the my favorite combos on the internet and lead you to the delicious world of sandwiches with chips on them. </p>
  <p> Take a look at this great starter recipe that the good folks from <a href="https://www.food.com/recipe/potato-chip-sandwich-371669"> Food.com </a> posted for us. </p>

   <p> While this recipe is a solid foundation, I personally would substitute the mayo with yellow mustard and add the <a href="https://www.ruffles.com/products/ruffles-jalape-o-ranch-flavored-potato-chips"> Ruffles Jalapeno Ranch </a> chip to expand the flavor of the turkey and add a touch of heat. <p>
